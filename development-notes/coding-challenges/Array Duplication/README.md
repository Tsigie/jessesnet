Array Duplication
===================

Source: Coding Interviews: Questions, Analysis, and Solutions

(1) An array contains n numbers ranging from 0 to n-2. There is exactly one number duplicated in the array. How do you find the duplicated number? For example, if an array with length 5 contains numbers {0, 2, 1, 3, 2}, the duplicated number is 2.

(2) An array contains n numbers ranging from 0 to n-1. There are some numbers duplicated in the array. It is not clear how many numbers are duplicated or how many times a number gets duplicated. How do you find a duplicated number in the array? For example, if an array of length 7 contains the numbers {2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 5, 3}, the implemented function (or method) should return either 2 or 3.
