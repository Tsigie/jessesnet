Array Value Summation
=============

Source: Algorithm Book by Karumanchi

Suppose you are given an integer c and an array, A, indexed from 1 to n, of n
integers in the range from 1 to 5n (possibly with duplicates). Describe an efficient algorithm for determining if there are two integers, A[i] and A[j], in A that sum to c, that is, such that c = A[i] + A[j].
