### Hacklang Generics Example

This is an example use case of using Hack generics.  The script file, storage.hh, uses a storage class, Drive.hh, to store various items of different types.  The Drive is then used by a consumer, Consumer.hh, which pulls the items from the drive and uses those items to do work.  This demonstrates how generics can give some flexibility to statically typed languages, both in the storage and use of various different types of items.
