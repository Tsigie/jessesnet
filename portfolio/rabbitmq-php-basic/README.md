### RabbitMQ PHP Basic Queue

Message queues, or job queues, allow web applications to control when and where tasks are performed. By distributing CPU or I/O intensive jobs over a server cluster, web applications can significantly improve performance, while maintaining a highly scalable infrastructure. It is essential to any message queue to have a reliable, flexible message server to handle message control, routing, etc. RabbitMQ is a robust message broker offering numerous configurations and options, and is proven to work well in high workload environments. For this project I will set up a simple PHP RabbitMQ work queue to demonstrate how a backend job queue could be architected and scaled.
